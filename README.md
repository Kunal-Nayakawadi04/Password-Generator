# Password-Generator
The Password Generator is a simple yet powerful web-based tool that helps users create secure, random passwords with customizable settings. Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is ideal for anyone looking to improve their password security by generating strong, unpredictable passwords in seconds.In today’s digital age, password security is more important than ever. Weak or reused passwords are a major vulnerability, often targeted by cyber attackers. This tool eliminates the guesswork by letting users generate complex passwords tailored to specific security needs.


Features:-
* Custom Length Control: Choose the length of your password (e.g., 8 to 32 characters).
* Character Set Options: Include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols.
* Instant Generation: Click a button to generate a password immediately.
* Copy to Clipboard: Easily copy the generated password for use elsewhere.
* Responsive Design: Works smoothly across desktop, tablet, and mobile browsers.
* Simple & Clean UI: Intuitive interface suitable for all users.

Technologies Used:-
* HTML: Structures the page elements and form inputs.
* CSS: Styles the UI with modern, responsive design.
* JavaScript: Handles password generation logic and user interactions.

How It Works:-
When the user selects the desired criteria (length, character types), JavaScript builds a character pool based on the selected options. It then randomly selects characters from this pool until the password reaches the chosen length. The result is displayed in a text box and can be copied with a single click.

Use Cases:-
* Creating strong passwords for online accounts
* Generating temporary or one-time-use credentials
* Demonstrating password security in educational settings
* Enhancing personal cybersecurity practices
